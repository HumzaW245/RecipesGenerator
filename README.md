Possible Additions:
- Tesseract OCR code: This will be used to read any image with text, store ingredients and use this list to generate recipes.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Data can be used to further extract most optimal recipes based on many factors. Popular ingredients, recipes, etc. All of these things can be further explored.
- Tensorflow or OpenCV usage: Simply taking a picture of fridge components and generating possible recipes from it.
